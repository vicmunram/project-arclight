A friend put me in touch with someone who might be able to help us.<br><br>He's a physicist named Andrew Burham.;
He says that he has a technology to crystallize all kinds of materials.<br><br>He showed me his prototype in operation and it seems to work moderately.;
I think it's what we need, but I'm not sure if I was right to accept what he asked of me.;
His hypothesis is that for crystallization to work correctly, it is necessary to apply the technology with greater power and on a larger surface.;
So he has asked me to do it in the mine.<br><br>I have already seen what happens if the device fails and the mine would completely collapse, but we have nothing to lose.;
I hope all this is worth it.<br><br>The next day we will do the experiment.
