We could say that the experiment was a success.<br><br>Burham was very excited. His hypothesis was completely correct.<br><br>Maybe too much.;
The crystallization worked in all the galleries and we will have resources to extract for many years, but it did not only affect the interior of the mine;
All the ground outside crystallized too, even the trees and a small lake nearby.;
In fact, we have found several crystals on the surface that emit energy, or so Burham says.<br><br>I just hope they are not radioactive.;
He has said that he is going to investigate them, that surely we can sell them as a new product and revolutionize the market.;
He makes me a little afraid of his ambition, but my father is smiling again and it won't be necessary to fire anyone, so I guess I can't complain.
