I've been in the mine with my father extracting crystals since I was little and I've never seen him like this.<br><br>Really, I've been with him in very tough situations, like when the entrance of a;
gallery collapsed and we had to be locked up for days until they could remove the rubble.<br><br>But this is different. He sees how the company that has cost him so much effort and suffering;
to build is going downhill. As a large number of families are going to be left without their livelihood.<br><br>But of course, if there are no crystals to extract, it's over.;
I can't sit idly by, I'm going to use my contacts. Someone has to be able to help us.
